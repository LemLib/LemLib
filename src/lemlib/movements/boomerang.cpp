/**
 * The boomerang controller is a motion algorithm inspired by adaptive PID seeking
 * and pure pursuit. While it can't be used to follow a path, it can be used to
 * move to a pose, that is a point and heading, by moving in a curved path.
 *
 * The algorithm works by calculating the "carrot point". Its calculated using
 * the distance from the robot to the target, multiplying it by the lead distance,
 * and then having it on the same angle from the target as the target heading.
 *
 * This may be more convenient than using pure pursuit, as it doesn't require
 * a path to be generated. Its also more suitable for smaller movements.
 * The controller does have some limitations, however. Since its velocity is
 * not computed in advance, the algorithm has some trouble with sharp turns.
 * The speed around corners should be limited, and this limit can vary greatly
 * between different drivetrains. This is solved by the chasePower parameter.
 * Its used along with an algorithm borrowed from pure pursuit which calculates
 * the curvature of an arc tangent to the heading of the robot and the carrot point,
 * and based on that it will generate a maximum speed the robot can move at.
