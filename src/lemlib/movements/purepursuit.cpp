 * We do this by converting the asset into a string, and then splitting this
 * string into lines. Then we iterate through each of these lines, and split
 * it into a vector of strings. We then convert each of these strings into
 * floats, and then push back a new waypoint to the path vector

/**
 * Pure Pursuit is a motion algorithm published by R. Craig Coulter in 1992
 * https://www.ri.cmu.edu/pub_files/pub3/coulter_r_craig_1992_1/coulter_r_craig_1992_1.pdf
 *
 * Pure pursuit is a path following algorithm. It works by finding the intersection between
 * an imaginary circle around the robot and the path. The robot then moves to the intersection
 * point by calculating the curvature of the arc formed by the robot and the intersection point.
 * This arc is also tangent to the heading of the robot.
 *
 * This algorithm does need a path to follow, and it can be generated using the LemLib
 * path generator (deprecated), or Path.JerryIO (https://path.jerryio.com). The path
 * determines the speed of the robot at each point, allowing for smooth deceleration
 * and a slower speed around corners, or a user defined speed.
