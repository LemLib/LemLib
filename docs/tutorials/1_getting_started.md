# 01 - Getting Started

## Introduction

Welcome to LemLib! This tutorial will walk you through the basics of LemLib and how to get everything set up.

## Installation - Development Environment

LemLib is a [PROS](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu) template, so you can use it with any text editor. However, we recommend using Visual Studio Code, as it has the best support for PROS.

To install Visual Studio Code, go to [https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com) and download the installer for your operating system.

<br>
Once you have installed it, open it and install the PROS extension. You can do this by clicking typing `Ctrl+Shift+X` (`âŒ˜+Shift+X` on Mac), searching for "PROS", and clicking the install button.

<br>

And finally, we can create a new project. Navigate to the new PROS tab on the left, and click the "Create New Project" button. Select a folder, a name, v5, and when asked to select a version, select "latest".

Now we can install LemLib!

## Installation

In Visual Studio Code, press the PROS button on the sidebar and click `Open Integrated Terminal`.

Then copy and paste one of the following into the terminal, and hit enter.
- latest stable version:
  ```bash
  pros c add-depot LemLib https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemLib/LemLib/depot/stable.json # adds LemLib's stable depot
  pros c apply LemLib # applies latest stable version of LemLib
  ```
- latest beta version:
  ```bash
  pros c add-depot LemLib https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemLib/LemLib/depot/stable.json # adds LemLib's stable depot
  pros c add-depot LemLib-beta https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LemLib/LemLib/depot/beta.json # adds LemLib's beta depot
  pros c apply LemLib # applies latest beta version of LemLib
  ```
Finally, put the following at the top of your `main.cpp` file:
```cpp
#include "lemlib/api.hpp"
```

You are now ready to start using LemLib!
