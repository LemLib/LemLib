# LemLib

Welcome to LemLib! This open-source PROS template aims to introduce common algorithms like Pure Pursuit and Odometry for new and experienced teams alike.

Currently, LemLib officially supports tank drive and differential drive chassis only. Proper support for holonomic and mecanum drives have not yet been implemented, but some users have reported success with them. Implementation is planned for v0.5.0.

The creation of this template was inspired by [EZ-Template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template) and [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib). We aim to develop a library that strikes a balance between ease-of-use, akin to that of EZ-Template, and comprehensive functionality, similar to that of OkapiLib.
